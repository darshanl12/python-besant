Strings:- strings is collection of sequence of character enclosed in " " or ' ' or '''  '''

      '''
*   we can access the character from the string by using forward index and backward index
*  string is immutable
*  we can find the length using length function                      0   1    2    3   4   5      ------>  forward / positive index
                                                                    ---------------------------
                                                                    P |  Y  | T |  H | O | N
                                                                   ----------------------------
                                                                    -6   -5   -4   -3  -2  -1         <---- backward/negative index



LIST:

list is collection of homogeneous or heterogeneous data.   -homogeneous name stored data are same thing
* list is mutable
* we can access the data from the list by using forward/positive index or negative/Backward index.
* we find length by using len()
* list are enclosed within square bracket.
* list are stored in String, int ,float  in single variable list.


   1) fruits = ["apple", "orange", "grapes"]
    print(fruits)
                        o/p --- apple, orange, grapes

   2) fruits = ["apple", "orange", "grapes"]
    print(fruits[2])
                      o/p  ---grapes

   3) data =[10, "python", 98.6, "BTM"]
      print(data)
      print(data[2])
      print(data[-2],data[-1])
                       
                      o/p ---- [10, 'python', 98.6, 'BTM']
                               98.6

--> Functions:

function is a collection of or group of statement to performing a specific task.
implement the function in python using def keyword

-- Advantages:
              1] Reusability of the code.
              2] Debugging will become very easy.


-- Functions are two types:

1] pre-defined functions:- this are available with interpreter.
2] user-defined functions:- programmer going to implement.

-- user-defined functions need to two components to implement:
   1] Function definition:- to Implement the task
   2] Function calling:- call the function definition

-- Syntax:

            def funname(args):       args->temporaray args/ formal args    #args(Arguments)
               statement1
               statement2
               statement3
               statement4
             funname(args)             args->actual args/ original args

-- we can develop user-defined functions in 3 ways
   
   1] without args
   2] with args
   3] with return type
           a.  Single return type
           b.  Multiple return type

   return: return is a keyword which will be perform two action at time.
           
          1] once return keyword saw by the interpreter , it will exit from the function immediate
          2] if any value / result
